# Insight: Movies and Series Search
Insight: Movies and TV Search is a Jetpack-powered, MVVM Android application that retrieves movie
and series information from the OMDb API. The user is presented with a search field upon entry where
they are required to provide a title of either a movie or series. Searching can either be for a movie 
or a series via the two call-to-action buttons presented. The results are displayed below the search
field and the user can click on the result to view the details.
